# Character Asset

This project uses `character_new` as the default character.

It is a free, rigged 3D character with a cute and playful style, suitable for games, animation tests, and creative scenes.

## Runtime Character

- `character_new.gltf`

## Included Animations

- Idle
- Walk
- Happy
- Sad
- Standing Jump
- Jump-Run
- Running

## Notes

- The character is rigged and animation-ready.
- The app currently uses locomotion and airborne clips during gameplay:
- `Idle`
- `Walk`
- `Running`
- `Standing Jump` (mapped to `jump`)
- `Jump-Run` (mapped to `jump_running`)
- Emote clips are also wired in:
- `Happy` (press `H` while grounded and idle)
- `Sad` (press `J` while grounded and idle)
