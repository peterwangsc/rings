narios including jet fires, water suppression (sprays and sprinklers), fuel
evaporation, and starvation conditions. Our framework enables interactive
heat sources, fire detectors, and realistic rendering of flames (e.g., laminar-to-
turbulent transitions and blue-to-orange color shifts). Our key contributions

1 Introduction
Simulating combustion in computer graphics poses substantial chal-
lenges due to the interplay of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics,
and chemical kinetics across multiple phases – solids, liquids, and
gases. Modeling combustion and fire effects is critical in many do-
mains: from visual storytelling in games and films [Nielsen et al .
2019], to safety training [Kinateder et al . 2014], fire suppression
planning [Cao et al . 2020], and wildfire research [Hädrich et al .
2021; Kokosza et al. 2024]. Furthermore, modeling different extin-
guishing behaviors is important for capturing the wide range of
fire-suppression phenomena encountered in real-world scenarios.
Whether it is a sprinkler diffusing fine water droplets, a fire extin-
guisher dispersing foam or gas, or a direct hose stream dousing
flames, each method interacts with combustion in distinct thermo-
and fluid-dynamic ways. Visually differentiating between extin-
guishing mechanisms – such as steam plumes from evaporation or
darkening flames due to oxygen deprivation – adds to the visual
fidelity and immersion to virtual scenes.
While computer graphics has made significant progress in flame
rendering and fluid animation [Kim et al. 2008; Nguyen et al. 2002;
Stam 1999], most existing techniques either simplify combustion
chemistry or focus solely on gaseous flames, ignoring phase tran-
sitions, multi-fuel reactions, or water-based suppression. On the
other hand, physics-based approaches for fire provide high-fidelity
models but are designed for predictive simulation and not for in-
teractive applications [Merci and Beji 2022; Nielsen et al . 2022].
Other approaches focus on simulating water [Clavet et al. 2005] also
undergoing temperature changes [Mihalef et al. 2006], the interac-
tion of multiple fluids [Losasso et al. 2006a], and the melting and
burning of solids into liquids and gases [Losasso et al. 2006b]. The
coupling of reactive multi-phase flow, with varying fuel composi-
tions and evaporation, remains largely unaddressed in an interactive
or controllable setting.
In this work, we present a physically-based combustion model
which addresses the simulation of multiple species at interactive
rates. Compared to other combustion models that focus on specific
aspects of combustion phenomena, our method trades descriptive
complexity for a more integrated combustion simulation. We show
that combustion across solids, liquids, and gases can be unified
within an efficient hybrid framework that couples Eulerian grids for
thermochemical fields with Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrody-
namics (SPH) for fluid motion and droplet dynamics. This enables
the simulation of a broad range of scenarios, such as premixed
flames, water sprays, candle and jet fires, and suppression via sprin-
klers and direct water jets. Unlike previous models, our framework
explicitly tracks major species – fuel, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitro-
gen, water vapor, and residuals – allowing stoichiometry-dependent
heat release, oxygen starvation, and phase transition effects such as
evaporation. Our approach extends the state-of-the-art of simulat-
ing combustion by modeling complete and incomplete combustion,
along with visual cues such as flame color shifts and smoke as well as
vapor transitions. Moreover, our solver efficiently couples chemical
kinetics and thermodynamics with a particle-grid representation to
maintain high accuracy with interactive runtime performance. Addi-
tionally, we render realistic flame and smoke behaviors, modulated
by environmental conditions and user-defined parameters.
In Fig. 1, we show a complex simulation showcasing the dynamic
interaction between fire and water. Three vehicles are engulfed
in intense flames which are being extinguished by a high-pressure
water jet. The interaction of fire and water results in large smoke and
vapor clouds. Our novel combustion model captures multi-species
thermodynamics, allowing realistic visualization of flame extinction
and complex thermal behaviors in reactive flows.
In summary, our contributions are (1) a hybrid combustion simu-
lation framework combining SPH with an Eulerian thermochemical
grid, (2) a stoichiometry-aware reaction and heat release model
spanning multiple combustion species, (3) a coupled liquid-gas-solid
model for extinguishing dynamics, and (4) an interactive param-
eter space for rendering and controlling fire behaviors in various
scenarios.
2 Related Work
Simulating fire and combustion has been a long-standing research
topic in both computer graphics and physics-based modeling. Semi-
nal books in combustion modeling and fluid dynamics include Merci
and Beji [2016], Kross and Potter [2014], Peters [2000], as well as
Bridson’s introduction to fluid solvers [Bridson 2015]. Fluid motion
in most fire models is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations, often discretized using semi-Lagrangian advection and
pressure projection [Versteeg and Malalasekera 2007].
In computer graphics, fire is typically modeled using computa-
tional fluid dynamics (CFD) and grid-based fluid solvers [Bridson
and Müller-Fischer 2007], which effectively capture both laminar
and turbulent flame behaviors [Hong et al. 2007; Nguyen et al. 2002;
Stam 1999], as well as smoke dynamics [Fedkiw et al. 2001; Pan and
Manocha 2017]. Various approaches have been developed for the vi-
sual modeling of fire, including physically-based methods [Nguyen
et al. 2002; Nielsen et al. 2022, 2019; Pegoraro and Parker 2006], tech-
niques that emphasize the physical properties of flames [Nguyen
et al. 2001], methods that prioritize artistic control [Aguilera and
Johansson 2019; Kim et al. 2017; Lamorlette and Foster 2002], and
models that rely on particle-based representations [Horvath and
Geiger 2009]. Futhermore, vorticity confinement [Bridson 2015] is a
widely used method to enhance the visual fidelity of flames.
In physics-based fire simulations, the modeling process aims to
accurately replicate the underlying thermodynamic and chemical
phenomena governing combustion. These simulations include de-
tailed representations of fluid motion, heat transfer, and combustion
reactions, incorporating processes such as convection, conduction,
radiation, and finite-rate chemical kinetics [Merci and Beji 2016].
Radiative heat transfer is commonly handled through models based
on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, with some approaches using ray cast-
ing techniques to approximate radiative heating of the surrounding
fuel [Stam and Fiume 1995]. By integrating these physical princi-
ples, such models can produce realistic flame behavior and energy
distribution, making them suitable for high-fidelity applications in
both visual effects and scientific visualization [Nielsen et al. 2022,
2019; Pegoraro and Parker 2006]. Chemical reactions in fire are often

modeled using modified Arrhenius equations as formalized in the
IUPAC Gold Book [1997], while the heat of combustion is computed
following thermochemical approaches [Schmidt-Rohr 2011].
More extreme combustion phenomena, such as explosions and
detonations, require compressible flow models [Ihm et al . 2004].
Kwatra et al. [2009] proposed a method that dynamically tran-
sitions between compressible and incompressible regimes, mak-
ing it suitable for simulating shock waves and pressure-driven
deflagrations in graphics contexts. Particle-based explosion mod-
els, such as that of Feldman et al. [2003], combine Eulerian air
simulation with Lagrangian fuel particles and approximate heat
transfer. Advection and diffusion are typically handled using semi-
Lagrangian schemes [Stam 1999], while pressure projection and
multigrid solvers are used for velocity field correction. Tools like
AMGCL [2019] and PyBullet [2021] as well as methods for fast
fluid simulations [Rabbani et al. 2022] support scalable fluid-rigid
interaction and large-scale solver efficiency. Sparse volumetric data
structures such as OpenVDB [2013] facilitate the efficient handling
of complex simulation domains at high resolution.
While we do not focus on simulating the combustion of solids,
several approaches leverage volumetric grids to enable the tracking
of disconnected, propagating fire fronts [Liu et al. 2012, 2009; Melek
and Keyser 2002; Zhao et al. 2003] and support fire spreading across
surfaces [Chiba et al. 1994]. Hong et al. [2010] present a method ca-
pable of modeling combustion under complex geometric constraints,
while Pirk et al. [2017] focus on the combustion of geometrically
complex plant models. Stomakhin et al. [2014] introduce a point-
based method for simulating heat transfer to capture the melting
and solidification of materials. Their approach models the thermo-
dynamic and mechanical behavior of various substances but lacks
support for real-time interaction and heat diffusion. More recently,
Liu et al. [2025] use signed distance fields to support the combustion
of general wooden structures. Their approach enables to efficiently
query the surface information required to compute the insulating
effect caused by the char layer.
Physically-based fire simulators have been developed to model the
complex interactions between combustion, fluid flow, and heat trans-
fer, particularly in engineering and safety-critical environments. The
Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), is a widely used computational fluid
dynamics tool for simulating fire-driven flows in buildings and en-
closures [McGrattan et al. 2013]. It incorporates low-Mach number
Navier-Stokes equations, radiation transport, combustion models,
and detailed treatment of smoke and heat propagation. Several meth-
ods aim at simulating combustion for wildfire scenarios, including
WFDS [Mell et al. 2007], WRF-Fire [Coen et al. 2013], CAWFE [Coen
2013], ABWiSE [Katan and Perez 2021], FIRETEC [Linn et al. 2002],
OpenFOAM[Lapointe et al. 2020], and QUIC-Fire [Linn et al. 2020].
Bakhshaii and Johnson [2019] offer a comprehensive review of
modeling strategies across empirical, physical, and hybrid domains,
highlighting the trade-offs between real-time capability and physical
accuracy.
Unlike the existing methods, which primarily focus on either high-
fidelity offline simulation or artist-driven visual effects, we introduce
a method that allows the interactive simulation of extinguishing
behaviors of flames. Furthermore, we devise a principled physics
model that can simulate stoichiometric reactions that accurately
capture heat release across multiple combustion regimes, including
diffusion and premixed flames.
3 Overview
Our hybrid multiphase fluid model is expressed in two different
spatial domains. We use a continuous Cartesian coordinate system
and a discrete uniform grid composed of voxels to capture gas, liquid,
and solid interactions relevant for combustion scenarios (see Fig. 2).
The discrete simulation domain represents either gaseous or solid
regions, using a binary occupancy flag. SPH particles representing
liquids are embedded in the continuous spatial domain and are
synchronized with the grid simulation.
At initialization, the solid geometry usually defined as meshes is
encoded as a dense point cloud (solids, Fig. 2a). Each point populates
a corresponding grid cell, which is flagged as solid and used to
enforce boundary conditions for velocity, temperature, and species
transport during simulation. A user can specify emitters to generate
SPH particles for fluids. Particles contribute mass, temperature,
and velocity to the underlying grid using conservative sampling
schemes (liquids, Fig. 2b, c). The particles explicitly represent the
liquid phase (e.g., water or ethanol) and model its behavior using
SPH forces to capture realistic fluid dynamics. Our SPH simulation
describes surface tension, pressure projection, and collision using
a double density relaxation scheme. Each gaseous grid cell stores
thermodynamic quantities including velocity, density, temperature,
and a vector of chemical species mass fractions 𝑌𝑖 (Fig. 3).

268:4 • Wrede, et al.
Our grid solver describes diffusion, pressure projection, liquid
evaporation, advection, buoyancy, combustion, vorticity confine-
ment, thermal properties, density, and species transport. Gas density
is dynamically updated from local temperature and species com-
position using a temperature-dependent ideal gas law formulation
describing chemical species evolution. This allows our model to
express stochiometric combustion over a range of different gas mix-
tures (gases, Fig. 2d).
Solid cells contribute to heat conduction and boundary enforce-
ment; liquid particles exchange mass and energy with the gas phase
through heat-driven evaporation (Fig. 2e). Particles whose lifetime
has expired (e.g., due to complete evaporation) are removed. This
two-way coupling handles multiphase interfaces and phenomena
such as heat conduction from solid walls into fluid, or energy-driven
phase transitions between liquid and vapor. Our evaporation model
includes both continuous heat-based mass loss and discrete droplet-
based evaporation tied to local energy budgets (Fig. 3).
Our approach supports modeling of thermodynamic processes
including conduction, and chemical kinetics using modified Arrhe-
nius equations, and supports grid-based combustion dynamics such
as flame propagation, soot production, and volumetric expansion
due to temperature increase. The model is designed to accommo-
date both physical approximations of deflagration scenarios and
artist-tuned stylizations, depending on the application domain.
4 Methodology
In this section, we present our multiphase combustion model. We
begin by outlining the equations for fluid motion, thermodynamics,
and species transport, including extensions for combustion-driven
buoyancy and heat generation. Finally, we detail the evaporation
model, which describes liquid–gas phase transitions based on ther-
mal energy balance and droplet-level resolution. A list of parameters
is included in Appendix A.1.
4.1 General
The simulation domain defines velocity, temperature, species frac-
tions, and material states, described by coupled PDEs for fluid dy-
namics, thermodynamics, and species transport as illustrated in
Fig. 3. To model natural convection (i.e., buoyancy-driven flow), the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is adapted to ideal gas flows
using the Boussinesq approximation and hydrostatic pressure is
neglected. We obtain the following momentum equation:
𝐷𝒖
𝐷𝑡 = 𝜈∇2𝒖 − 1

. (1)
Here, 𝒖 denotes the velocity field, 𝜈 the kinematic viscosity, 𝜌 the
fluid’s local density,𝑝 pressure, 𝑇 temperature, and 𝑇amb the ref-
erence ambient temperature. The right term with effective gravity
𝒈 introduces buoyancy based on temperature difference, enabling
plume rise and convection effects critical for combustion-driven
flows.
Thermal transport is governed by a modified heat equation which
has been extended with radiative cooling and a combustion energy
source term. We obtain

evaporation, and combustion.
in which𝑘 denotes thermal conductivity,𝐶𝑝 specific heat at constant
pressure, 𝜖 emissivity, and 𝜎 the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The
radiative term accounts for the net exchange of energy with the
environment. The source term 𝐽𝑐 (see Eq. 6) incorporates the local
heat release rate from combustion.
The evolution of chemical species is handled per-species, i.e.,
𝐷𝑌𝑖
𝐷𝑡 = 𝐷𝑖 ∇2𝑌𝑖 + 𝑣𝑐𝑞𝑖 𝑀𝑖
𝜌 + 𝑆𝑖 , (3)
in which 𝑌𝑖 denotes mass fraction of species 𝑖, 𝐷𝑖 diffusion coeffi-
cient, and 𝑆𝑖 represents the source term from the phase change.
4.2 Combustion
We model combustion using a simplified global one-step reaction
mechanism. The heat of combustion is approximated from the em-
pirical formula of the fuel:
Δ𝑐𝐻𝑜 ≈ −417(𝑐 + 0.25ℎ − 0.5𝑜) . (4)
This estimates the lower heating value (measured in kJ mol−1) for
hydrocarbon fuels of composition 𝐶𝑐𝐻ℎ𝑂𝑜 𝑁𝑛 [Schmidt-Rohr 2015].
The combustion rate follows an Arrhenius-type expression
𝑣𝑐 = 𝐴𝑇𝑛 exp

𝑐𝑎
𝑓 𝑐𝑏
𝑜 , (5)
in which 𝑣𝑐 denotes the volumetric reaction rate, 𝑇 temperature, 𝑅
universal gas constant, 𝐴 pre-exponential factor, and 𝐸𝑎 activation
energy. The molar concentrations of fuel and oxidizer 𝑐 𝑓 and 𝑐𝑜 are
raised to empirical exponents 𝑎 and 𝑏. The resulting combustion
energy rate per unit volume is given by
𝐽𝑐 = −𝜑𝑣 𝑐 Δ𝑐𝐻 0 (6)
which occurs in Eq. 2 feeding back the heat release into the thermal
equation. We use 𝜑 as a weighting factor for adjusting the heat
efficiency of the combustion (e.g., in the case of an incomplete
combustion).

Propane (d), Methane (e), and Ethylene (f). Our framework enables simulating stoichiometric mixtures of various fuels. The combustion patterns reflect
differences in turbulence, stability, and height, related to molecule properties.
Moreover, species evolution from the combustion reaction is mod-
eled by
𝜕𝑌𝑖
𝜕𝑡 = 𝑣𝑐𝑞𝑖 𝑀𝑖
𝜌 , (7)
in which 𝑞𝑖 denotes the stoichiometric coefficient for species 𝑖 with
molar mass 𝑀𝑖.
To complete the system, we relate the gas density to pressure,
temperature, and mixture composition using the ideal gas law:

where 𝑅 is the universal gas constant. This formulation accounts for
varying mixture composition and temperature effects in a physically
grounded manner.
4.3 Evaporation Model
To model phase change from liquid to gas, we implement an energy-
driven evaporation scheme. The liquid density 𝜌𝑙 decreases accord-
ing to the local energy surplus:
𝜕𝜌𝑙
𝜕𝑡 = − 𝜌𝑙𝐶𝑝 (𝑇𝑙 − 𝑇amb)
𝐶𝑝 (𝑇𝐵 − 𝑇amb) + Δ𝑣𝐻 0 , (9)
in which 𝑇𝑙 denotes the current liquid temperature, 𝑇𝐵 boiling tem-
perature, 𝐶𝑝 liquid specific heat capacity, and Δ𝑣𝐻 0 latent heat of
vaporization. Droplet conduction accelerates the heat transfer be-
tween the air and the liquid as we assume a spray of droplets instead
of a laminar flow:
𝑇𝑑𝑐 = 𝜌𝑙
𝜌𝑑
𝐴𝑑
𝑑𝑑
(𝑇𝑙 − 𝑇 ) , 𝜕𝑇
𝜕𝑡 = 𝑘𝑇𝑑𝑐
𝜌𝐶𝑝
, 𝜕𝑇𝑙
𝜕𝑡 = −𝑘𝑇𝑑𝑐
𝜌𝐶𝑝
. (10)
The droplet’s diameter is denoted with𝑑𝑑, its surface area with 𝐴𝑑,
and its density with 𝜌𝑑. Please note that the latter one does not
correspond to the liquid density, but instead to the amount of liquid
in the form of droplets.
The mass fraction of a specific species changes based on the
evaporated density and an evaporation coefficient. This decouples
the evaporation process from the actual liquid and gas compositions,
and enables the evaporation of different mixtures:
𝜕𝑌𝑖
𝜕𝑡 = Γ𝑖 𝜌𝑙 (= 𝑆𝑖 ) , (11)
in which Γ𝑖 denotes the evaporation coefficient for a specific species.
5 Algorithmics and Implementation
Our simulation framework is implemented inRust and usesWGPU
as the primary GPU abstraction layer for compute shaders written
inWGSL. The system architecture is based on theshipyard entity-
component system, providing structured, parallel simulation state
management. User interaction and visualization are handled through
winit for windowing and egui for the GUI layer. All results pre-
sented in this paper were generated on a workstation equipped with
an Intel i9-13900K CPU, 128 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA RTX 4090
GPU. The implementation closely follows the numerical model de-
scribed in Algo. 1 which summarizes the complete simulation loop,
incorporating Eulerian fluid dynamics for gas and heat transport,
Lagrangian SPH for liquid behavior, and thermochemical models
for evaporation, phase change, and combustion.
To differentiate between all the different parts of the system,
we settled on a few different subscripts. The subscript 𝑠 denotes
properties that are only used for the correct behavior of the SPH
system and therefore only appear in particle to particle interactions.
The subscript 𝑝 is used for particle properties that can are exchanged
with the grid. Both quantities, marked with either 𝑠 or 𝑝, are stored
in the particles. Liquid properties that are stored in the grid are
denoted by 𝑙. All other properties that are stored in the grid are
written without any subscript.
5.1 Data Structures and Initialization
The simulation domain is defined on a voxel grid, where each cell is
flagged as gas, solid, or gas+liquid. Scalar fields such as temperature
𝑇 , species mass fractions𝑌𝑖, and pressure 𝑝 are stored at cell centers,
while velocity 𝒖 is represented in a staggered marker-and-cell (MAC)
grid layout with components stored at face centers [Bridson 2015].
Solid obstacles are initialized as uniformly distributed particles,
which allows for particle-particle collisions. These are then sampled
onto the grid and cells are flagged as a solid accordingly. This dual
representation of solids enables both the particles and the grid to
interact with solids. Dirichlet boundary conditions (fixed values) on
solid walls are applied for velocity and Neumann (zero-gradient)
conditions for pressure. Slip conditions are enforced with mirrored
ghost cells [Bridson 2015]. For temperature, we impose fixed wall

values and apply one-sided derivatives near boundaries. The simula-
tion uses a fixed timestep constrained by Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy
(CFL) criteria for both advection and diffusion.
SPH particles can be introduced into user-defined regions of a
continuous Cartesian coordinate system and are colocated with
the voxel grid. Each particle carries velocity 𝒖𝑝, temperature 𝑇𝑝,
mass 𝑚𝑝, and thermophysical properties such as specific heat and
vaporization enthalpy. SPH-to-grid interpolation is performed using
compact support kernels and normalization factors to ensure con-
servative transfer of physical quantities. A list of SPH parameters is
included in the Appendix (Tab. A.1.2).
5.2 Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
Liquid behavior such as water spray, suppression, and droplet dy-
namics is handled using SPH. We use pseudo-pressure and pseudo-
density formulations from Clavet et al. [2005]. Particle to particle
interactions are handled within the smoothing radiusℎ𝑠. The neigh-
borhoods of the particles are denoted with 𝑁𝑠 (𝑖) with 𝑟𝑠𝑖 𝑗 ≤ ℎ𝑠 and
𝑟𝑠𝑖 𝑗 as the Euclidean distance between two particles. Each particle’s
local density is estimated by
𝜌𝑠𝑖 =
∑︁
𝑗 ∈𝑁𝑠 (𝑖 )

1 −
𝑟𝑠𝑖 𝑗
ℎ𝑠
2
. (12)
Furthermore, a near-density term is computed with a cubic kernel.
This allows for surface tension effects and particle collision avoid-
ance due to the flat gradient of the quadratic smoothing kernel. It is
defined by
𝜌near
𝑠𝑖 =
∑︁

where 𝑘𝑠 and 𝑘near𝑠 are stiffness coefficients and𝜌𝑠0 is the rest density.

where 𝛼 and 𝛽 control linear and quadratic damping, respectively.
5.3 Particle-Grid Sampling
To exchange information between SPH particles and the Euler-
ian grid, we use a weighted sampling approach based on a simple
distance kernel. This sampling uses a different smoothing radius,
denoted ℎ, with the corresponding neighborhood 𝑁 containing all
particles that satisfy 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 ≤ ℎ. The distance here is the Euclidean
distance between positions in the grid and particle positions. We

and an even more turbulent flame which shows large amounts water vapor

begin by defining a linear distance-based weight between particle 𝑖
and grid cell 𝑗, i.e.,

The mass of particles is used to accumulate the total liquid density
contribution to grid cell 𝑗:

To normalize contributions, we compute a sampling normalization

The velocity of the liquid is also sampled, but only from the particles
to the grid. This allows us to model different effects, like the Venturi
effect and the rapid increase in air velocity after the evaporation
of water. However, since we only sample in one direction, we do
not need to ensure consistency between both directions, which
simplifies the problem. Using the average velocity of all neighboring
cells is sufficient, as we scale the liquid velocity with the sampled
density when applying it to the gas velocity:

5.4 Droplet based Evaporation
The evaporation, just like the combustion, is done on the grid. This
is possible because we have bidirectional sampling of the liquid
properties between the grid and the SPH system. Before the evap-
oration is calculated, the liquid properties are sampled from the
particles at the beginning of the grid update step and stored in the
grid as the liquid properties. After the evaporation, the particle
properties are sampled from the grid again before the end of the
grid update step. Since we model the liquid as a spray of droplets,
we can partially evaporate a liquid cell. To handle droplet-based
evaporation explicitly, we define the total available energy in the
liquid cell as
𝐸𝑙 = (𝑇𝑙 − 𝑇amb)𝐶𝑝 𝜌𝑙𝑉𝑐 (26)
and the energy required to evaporate one droplet by
𝐸𝑑 = (𝐶𝑝 (𝑇𝐵 − 𝑇amb) + Δ𝑣𝐻 0)𝜌𝑑𝑉𝑑 . (27)
Assuming 𝑛𝑑 total droplets, the energy balance equation becomes
𝐸𝑙 = 𝐸𝑑𝑛𝑑 , 𝜌 𝑙 = 𝜌𝑑𝑛𝑑 . (28)
The number of droplets𝑛𝑒 = 𝐸𝑙 /𝐸𝑑, which can be evaporated, is then
computed based on the energy budget and the resulting evaporated
liquid density by 𝜌𝑒 = 𝑛𝑒 𝜌𝑑𝑉𝑑 /𝑉𝑐. This formulation allows droplets
to evaporate incrementally based on the available local energy while
ensuring both energy and mass conservation across the grid and
the SPH domain.
After evaporation, the new mixture density ratio is computed to
adjust thermodynamic properties, i.e.,
𝜌′ = 𝜌
𝜌 + Δ𝜌𝑙
, (29)
the gas temperature is adjusted to reflect the thermal mixing with
vapor at boiling point, i.e.,
𝑇 ′ = (1 − 𝜌′)𝑇𝐵 + 𝜌′𝑇 , (30)
and species mass fractions 𝑌𝑖 are rescaled proportionally, i.e.,
𝑌 ′
𝑖 = 𝜌′𝑌𝑖 . (31)
We also use the liquid velocity to model a change in gas velocity
similar to the rapid expansion of evaporated water. This is done by
using the evaporated density fraction and using it to interpolate
between the gas and the liquid velocity:
𝒖′ = (1 − 𝜌′)𝒖𝑙 + 𝜌′𝒖 . (32)
Fig. 6. Visualization of flame behavior: a flame in a contained environment
is undergoing oxygen starvation from an early stage (top row) to a later stage
(bottom row). The images show the RGB rendering (a, e), the temperature
field (b, f), fuel (green) and oxygen (blue) (c, g), and CO2 (d, h). In the later
stage (bottom row), the flame becomes less intense, temperature drops, and
a significant decrease in oxygen concentration is observed which leads to
the extinction of the flame.
5.5 Simulation Loop
The main simulation loop has been implemented according to Algo. 1.
All scalar and vector fields on the grid and particles are initialized
to default or user-provided values (Lines 1–4). This includes setting
𝒖, 𝑇 , 𝜌, 𝑌𝑖 on the grid, and initializing 𝒖𝑝, 𝑇𝑝, 𝑚𝑝 for each particle.
Pseudo-density and near-density are computed for each particle
(Eqs. 12 and 13), followed by pressure forces (Eqs. 14 and 15), viscos-
ity forces (Eq. 17), and advection. Boundary enforcement at walls is
handled using ghost particles and velocity reflection schemes (Lines
5–12). SPH particles contribute to the grid via weighted kernel sam-
pling of mass, temperature, and velocity (Eqs. 19, 23 and 25). The
weighting functions are normalized per cell to maintain conserva-
tion (Lines 13–14).
The gas solver runs a sequence of updates: semi-Lagrangian ad-
vection, Boussinesq buoyancy, chemical reaction modeling (Eqs. 1
and 3), radiative thermal exchange (Eq. 2), and thermal as well as
species diffusion. The Arrhenius equation is checked for each cell
to combust the available fuel and oxygen, resulting in changes in
temperature and species composition (Eqs. 4, 5 and 7). In grid cells
containing a hot liquid, thermodynamic conditions are evaluated
to trigger evaporation (Eqs. 9 to 11 and 26 to 31). Adjustments are
made to local temperature, species mass fractions, and particle mass.
Incompressibility is enforced by solving a pressure Poisson equation
using a GPU-based iterative solver (Lines 15-22). The grid fields are
interpolated back to SPH particles (Lines 23–24), updating their
mass and temperature values using conservative kernels (Eqs. 21

5.6 Visualization
We use ray marching augmented with global illumination (GI) tech-
niques to render dynamic imagery of combustion phenomena. The
ray marcher samples a set of 3D scalar fields including residual his-
tory for sooting, CO2, fuel, oxygen, liquid density, temperature, and
vapor, to visualize complex interactions of solids, liquids and gases.
Meshes are rendered via BVH-accelerated ray tracing with support
for physically based material for rendering (PBR). We handle trans-
parent materials like water and glass through index-of-refraction
tracking and refraction modeling using Snell’s law, which allows us
to render droplets and laminar flow. For scenes involving complex
meshes (Figs. 1, 12, 18) we employ a Monte-Carlo path tracer, which
marches through the volume grid before every bounce to integrate
emission, absorption, and scattering into radiance [Pharr et al. 2016].
Fig. 7. A parameter space exploration of the water vapor and residual reac-
tion coefficient. Starting from an entirely transparent flame (bottom left)
we show the increase of residuals from left to right (horizontal axis) and the
increase of vapor from bottom to top (vertical axis).
We then apply a denoising step to lower the necessary sample count
for high quality renderings [Áfra 2025].
Flame coloration is determined through a combination of black-
body radiation and chemiluminescence modeling [Stewart and John-
son 2016]. The latter captures the spectral contributions of radicals
like 𝐶𝐻 ∗ (blue-green light) and 𝐶2∗ (green light), which are in-
ferred from local combustion activity and fuel richness, modulated
by temperature. Residuals and soot, are tracked in a 3D texture
and contribute both as light blockers at low temperatures and as
emissive blackbody sources for hot gases. The soot map is used
to darken the sooted surfaces, which enhances the realism of the
material being exposed to combustion. For the figures rendered
without path tracing, fire glow is instead further intensified by a
bloom post-processing pass. Volumetric effects include colorless
smoke that attenuates light and steam, which cast shadow rays to
add depth and softness.
6 Results and Validation
To demonstrate the capabilities of our framework, we present re-
sults and validation obtained from various simulation experiments.

Fig. 8. Water extinguishing experiments: we use two nozzle types to generate a laminar (a)-(h) and a spray (i-p) type of water stream to extinguish a flame
and show the impact of aiming the water at the top of the flame (a-d, i-l) and at the bottom of the flame (e-h, m-p). For each fire-water interaction we show
the average spatio-temporal temperatures (d, h, l, p) which show the overall effectiveness of extinquishing a flame during an experiment. A laminar water
stream directed at the top of a flame does not impact the fire which leads to an overall high temperature. A spray stream directed at the bottom of the fire
immediately stops the fire resulting in an overall lower temperature (p).

Specifically, we show that our method reproduces key physical
behaviors in combustion, evaporation, and fluid coupling scenarios.
6.1 Results
We organize our qualitative experiments into topical groups, each
exploring different aspects of combustion dynamics, multiphase in-
teractions, or system behavior under physically plausible conditions.
The experiments range from fine-scale features such as flame struc-
ture to complex scene-level behavior. In the Appendix, we include
a table with parameter value ranges for user-controlled parame-
ters (Tab. 3) and fixed parameters calibrated with values found in
literature (Tab. 4).
6.1.1 Combustion and Flame Behavior. To evaluate how our frame-
work handles fuel-dependent combustion dynamics, we simulate
stoichiometric mixtures of various hydrocarbons. Specifically, we
compare flame development 800 ms after ignition for six common
fuels: Acetylene, Butane, Cyclopropane, Propane, Methane, and
Ethylene (Tab. 1 for parameter values). In Fig. 4 we show the re-
sulting flame and smoke plume structures. Although all cases begin
with identical ignition conditions and domain setup, we set different
Arrhenius equation parameter values based on the fuel and chemical
properties for all gases. Acetylene (Fig. 4a) produces a tall, narrow
flame with strong vertical acceleration, indicating high combustion
velocity and low molecular weight. In contrast, Butane (Fig. 4b) and
Propane (Fig. 4d) form broader, more turbulent plumes, consistent
with their heavier hydrocarbon structure. Cyclopropane (Fig. 4c)
exhibits structured vortex rings and moderate turbulence. Methane
(Fig. 4e) yields a clean and vertically stable flame. Ethylene (Fig. 4f)
generates more complex turbulence and brighter flame fronts due
to its increased chemical reactivity.
In Fig. 5 we show four different types of small flame combus-
tion, illustrating the range of flame appearance our method can
simulate. We calibrate combustion parameter values such as buoy-
ancy, combustion heat efficiency𝜑, radiation coefficient 𝜖, residual
produced 𝑞𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 , and vorticity confinement strength for each ex-
periment. Fig. 5a shows a clean combustion, typical of a Bunsen
burner with premixed fuel. In Fig. 5b a flame with minor traces of
glowing residuals is shown. A near-complete combustion occurs
at the base while water vapor and glowing residuals appear in the
upper regions (Fig. 5c). A more turbulent flame is shown in Fig. 5d,
which is characterized by substantial amounts of water vapor and
residuals.
Fig. 11. Simulation showing fire suppression at a window using principles
of fluid dynamics. Flames and hot gases vent from the window (a). A water
stream is directed outward from the window (b), creating a high-velocity
flow that induces a low-pressure zone outside (Bernoulli Principle). This
draws heat, smoke, and flames out of the room while limiting air entrain-
ment into the structure. The window opening acts as a constriction (Venturi
Effect), accelerating the outward flow and enhancing the removal of hot
gases (c). The fire is effectively suppressed as interior temperatures drop
and oxygen supply is reduced (d).
To further investigate the expressiveness of our model, we con-
duct a parameter space exploration by varying the water vapor
(vertical axis) and the residual reaction coefficients (horizontal axis)
in Fig. 7. The bottom-left corner corresponds to the minimal con-
figuration where both coefficients are set to zero. Increasing the
water vapor coefficient vertically (bottom to top) introduces pro-
gressively more visible steam and white combustion products. In-
creasing the residual coefficient horizontally (left to right) adds dark
soot and incomplete combustion effects. While these coefficients
do not influence the combustion process itself, they modulate the
final appearance of the combustion products. This parameter space
exploration illustrates our framework’s capability in smoothly cap-
turing the visual transition from clean, complete combustion to
sooty, oxygen-limited burns. Note that the scale of the residual co-
efficient is logarithmic (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10), whereas the water vapor
coefficient is linear (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10).
To further analyze combustion dynamics under varying fuel–
oxygen ratios, we simulate the combustion of methane and oxygen
in a nitrogen environment while varying the fuel mass fraction. In
Fig. 9 we visualize this process using color-coded species: oxygen
in blue, fuel in green, and flame intensity in yellow-orange. Across
three scenarios, the oxygen flow remains constant, while the fuel
concentration increases from a lean to a rich mixture. In the first two
frames (Fig. 9a, b), combustion occurs under fuel-lean conditions,
producing small and intermittent flames. In Fig. 9c and Fig. 9d we
show the equal mixture of fuel and oxygen, resulting in strong,
vertically stable flames and optimal combustion efficiency. Finally,

Fig. 12. Two frames of a timeseries showing the extinction of a complex fire. Three vehicles are vigorously burning (a). The fire is then suppressed by a
high-pressure water jet (b), producing dense clouds of smoke and vapor. Our advanced combustion model supports multi-species thermodynamics and
accurately simulates flame extinction dynamics.
Fig. 13. Ablation study of the dispersion and displacement terms of our
model. Enabling both terms causes water to evaporate while the water
generates a drag on the fire and vapor (a). Disabling the displacement term
leads to a vapor cloud that is not affected by the water (b). Only enabling
the displacement term shows that the fire is dragged in the direction of
the water (c). Disabling both terms leaves only the diffuse temperature
exchange, which is too slow to have an effect on the fast interaction of
flames and water.
in Fig. 9e and Fig. 9f, the excess fuel leads to a rich mixture, where
incomplete combustion reduces flame visibility and promotes soot
formation.
6.1.2 Liquid–Fire Interaction and Evaporation. We further analyze
the interaction between water jets and flame behavior by comparing
laminar and spray nozzles, each aimed either at the top or bottom
of the flame. As shown in Fig. 8a–d, a laminar stream directed
toward the top of the flame has a limited extinguishing effect. The
flame remains largely intact (Fig. 8a–c), and the spatio-temporal
temperature map (Fig. 8d) shows only a localized temperature drop
with high overall residual heat. In contrast, when the same laminar
stream is aimed at the base of the flame (Fig. 8e–h), it disrupts the
combustion zone more effectively, with Fig. 8h indicating lower core
temperatures and a cooling effect extending upward.
The spray nozzle produces a finer, more distributed stream that
further improves the extinguishing. When directed at the top of
the flame (Fig. 8i–l), it produces dense vapor and drag, but still fails
to fully suppress combustion (Fig. 8l). Finally, the spray directed
at the bottom of the flame (Fig. 8m–p) results in complete flame
suppression and the thermal field in Fig. 8p shows a significant
reduction in overall temperature.
To analyze evaporation-driven combustion, we simulate a sce-
nario in which a stream of liquid fuel is injected into an existing
flame. As shown in Fig. 10a, the fuel begins to evaporate upon con-
tact with surrounding hot gases, forming a vapor-rich region near
the jet. This vapor mixes with ambient oxygen and ignites, extend-
ing the existing flame in direction of the jet (Fig. 10b). In Fig. 10c,
the ignited liquid fuel continues to collide with a wall.
6.1.3 Physics Probes and Diagnostics. To examine how our sim-
ulations can assist in fire suppression, we simulate the use of a
high-velocity stream directed at a burning window opening. As
shown in Fig. 11a, flames and hot gases naturally vent outward
from the structure. In Fig. 11b, a water jet is introduced in front
of the window, generating a fast-moving outflow that lowers the
local pressure outside the window based on the Bernoulli principle.
This pressure drop draws flames and hot gases out of the room. The
window itself acts as a geometric constriction, and as illustrated in
Fig. 11c, this narrowing accelerates the exiting flow in accordance
with the Venturi effect. As a result, smoke and thermal energy are
more efficiently expelled. Finally, Fig. 11d shows that interior flames
weaken significantly as oxygen inflow is reduced and overall tem-
peratures drop. This diagnostic case demonstrates how directed
airflow can passively assist fire mitigation.
To study combustion under limited oxygen conditions, we simu-
late a small flame undergoing progressive oxygen starvation. Fig. 6
shows visualizations at two distinct stages: early (top row, Fig. 6a–d)
and late (bottom row, Fig. 6e–h). RGB renderings in Fig. 6a and 6e
illustrate a clear decrease in flame luminosity and size over time. The
corresponding temperature fields (Fig. 6b, f) confirm this drop, with
lower peak temperatures and reduced vertical heat transport. Fuel
and oxygen distributions (green and blue, respectively) in Fig. 6c
and 6g show that the available oxygen diminishes significantly in
the later stage. Finally, the CO 2 field in Fig. 6d and 6h confirms
incomplete combustion and suppressed chemical reaction. This di-
agnostic setup validates our model’s ability to simulate extinction
phenomena resulting from local oxygen depletion.

Fig. 14. Comparison of our simulation and FDS [McGrattan et al. 2013]. We use the experiment setup described in NBSIR 79-1910 [McCaffrey 1979] to measure
the average temperature of all sensors over a period of 30 seconds for flames with an energy of 14 kW (a) and 57 kW (d). We measure the mean and standard
deviation of temperatures measured at each sensor for flames of 14 kW and 57 kW for FDS (b, e) and for our simulation (c, f). We also compared FDS with our
simulation on a sprinkler setup for which we measure the average temperature (g) as well as the mean and standard deviation for FDS (h) and our simulation
(i). The results indicate that our framework is able to closely match the simulation results of FDS for both experiments.

described in NBSIR 79-1910 [McCaffrey 1979] (a) and a sprinkler experi-
ment (a-d) that we use to compare our model to FDS.
6.1.4 Emergency Response Devices. Fig. 18 illustrates a fire emer-
gency scenario in a residential kitchen. A stovetop ignition initiates
a spreading flame Fig. 18a, which triggers a smoke detector and
activates an overhead sprinkler system Fig. 18b. Our simulation cap-
tures the subsequent interaction between the water spray and the
hot combustion gases, showing both flame suppression and vapor
generation. This example highlights the potential of physics-based
fire simulation as an in silico test bed for evaluating real-world fire
response strategies.
6.1.5 Multiphase Scene-Level Experiments. In Fig. 12 we show two
frames from a time series illustrating the extinction of a complex
fire scenario. In the initial frame (a), three vehicles are burning. The
combustion leads to pronounced flame structures and smoke. In the
subsequent frame (b), the fire is actively being suppressed by a high-
pressure water jet, resulting in dense plumes of smoke and vapor.
With our multi-species thermodynamics model it is possible to
realistically simulate the interaction between fire and extinguishing
agents, capturing the nuanced dynamics of flame extinction and
post-combustion behavior.
In Fig. 16 we show the annealing process of a metal rod. Initially,
a flame is applied (Fig. 16a) and gradually heats the rod (Fig. 16b, c)
until it begins to glow visibly. Once the flame is removed (Fig. 16d),
the rod continues to emit a glow as it slowly cools down, eventually
returning to its original state (Fig. 16e, f).
6.2 Validation
We evaluated our combustion model qualitatively and quantitatively,
including comparisons of our simulation results with an established
solver for combustion, visual comparisons to previous approaches,
and ablations studies of different components of our framework.
Runtime performance measures are shown in the Appendix (Tab. 2).
6.2.1 Comparison to McCaffrey and FDS. We conducted a series
of comparative experiments against both real measurements of
combustion experiments as well as established combustion solvers
(FDS [McGrattan et al. 2013]). The first experiment replicates the
enclosure fire test described in NBSIR 79-1910 [McCaffrey 1979]
conducted in a 1.5m × 1.5m × 3.9m sized compartment (see Fig. 15a).
A natural gas burner with a heat release rate of approximately 14.4
to 57.5 kW was used, producing a steady diffusion flame. The flame
was placed on a pedestal of 0.72 m height. To capture the vertical

temperature profile and development of the hot gas layer 21 temper-
ature sensors were installed in a vertical line at heights ranging from
0.05m to 3.0m from the pedestal. We use this data for validating the
thermal and fluid dynamic behavior of our solver. In Fig. 14 we show
a comparative analysis of FDS and our framework on this setup.
Specifically, we analyze the average temperature recorded by all
sensors over a continuous 30-second interval for flame heat release
rates of 14 kW and 57 kW, as illustrated in Fig. 14a and Fig. 14d,
respectively. Blue lines indicate our temperature evolution which
closely conforms to the red lines resulting from the equivalent FDS
simulation. Beyond average temperatures, we further assess the
spatial temperature distribution by computing the mean and stan-
dard deviation of the temperature at each individual sensor location.
This analysis is conducted separately for the 14 kW (Fig. 14a-c) and
57 kW (Fig. 14d-f) flame scenarios for FDS and our model. These
results reveal a strong correlation between our simulation outputs
and those generated by FDS, thereby indicating that our framework
is able to replicate complex thermal behaviors observed in standard
fire scenarios.
In Fig. 17, we show the centerline temperature rise ( Δ𝑇 ) as a
function of height (𝑧) above the burner for various heat release rates
(𝑄), comparing results from our thermodynamics model with those
from FDS. The plot illustrates how temperature varies along the
vertical axis of the flame for different fire sizes (14.4 kW, 33 kW,
57.5 kW), highlighting the thermal behavior within the plume. The
results demonstrate that our model not only reproduces the exper-
imentally observed temperature rise (NBSIR 79-1910 [McCaffrey
1979]) with high fidelity but also shows strong agreement with the
FDS simulation outputs.
In a second experiment, we simulate a sprinkler activation sce-
nario, comparing the fire suppression dynamics, spray interaction,
and temperature decay between our solver and FDS. We use the
same 1.5m × 1.5m × 3.9m sized compartment with a pedestal (0.72m
height) and a 33 kW flame. After 15 seconds a water sprinkler (with
300 liters/min) is started, which causes the extinction of the flame.
A visualization of our setup is shown in Fig. 15a-d. The average
temperatures of FDS and our simulation as well as the mean and
standard deviations of individual sensors are shown in Fig. 14g-i.
These results show that our framework is able to extinguish fire
with similar temperature characteristics as FDS.
6.2.2 Qualitative Validation. To assess the visual fidelity of our
method, we performed a qualitative comparison against the flame
results shown in Nielsen et al. [2022]. Fig. 19 illustrates this com-
parison across both large and small flame regimes. In Fig. 19a, we
show the result from Nielsen et al. [2022], and in Fig. 19b, our frame-
work produces a similarly detailed large-scale flame, including fine
turbulent structures. This demonstrates that our model supports
high-resolution flames without requiring an explicit signed distance
field to track the flame front. However, in the small-flame regime,
Fig. 19c and Fig. 19d show real flames with sharp, thin flame fronts
such as those from Bunsen burners, which are well-represented in
Nielsen et al. ’s [2022] method. By contrast, Fig. 19e shows that our
approach is less suited for this regime due to its lack of flame front
modeling, resulting in a more diffuse appearance.

the temperature of a metal rod (b) until it starts to glow (c). After the flame
is turned off (d), the rod remains glowing (e) until it is entirely cooled off (f).

centerline temperature rise (ΔT) versus height (z) for various heat release
rates (Q). This figure illustrates how the temperature along the flame’s
centerline changes with height above the burner for different fire sizes. The
results indicate that our framework closely matches the measured rise in
temperature as well as the simulated results of FDS.
6.2.3 Dispersion Ablation. To evaluate the significance of disper-
sion and displacement forces in water–fire interaction, we con-
duct an ablation study comparing four configurations. As shown in
Fig. 13a, enabling both the dispersion and displacement terms pro-
duces the expected interaction: water evaporates rapidly, forming
vapor, and simultaneously pushes back the flame through drag. In
Fig. 13b, we disable the displacement term while keeping dispersion
active. This leads to a vapor cloud forming correctly, but with no
coupling to the flame, which continues burning undisturbed. In
Fig. 13c, we disable dispersion but retain displacement. The flame is
physically deflected by the incoming spray, yet vapor formation is
nearly absent, indicating that momentum exchange alone is insuffi-
cient for suppression. Finally, Fig. 13d disables both terms, leaving
only passive heat transfer. In this case, the flame remains stable, with
neither visible vapor nor dynamic suppression. This comparison
illustrates that both dispersion and displacement are essential for
simulating fast and realistic flame response and visible water-driven
disruption.

larger flames (b) with a similar degree of complexity (a). As we do not
explicitly compute the flame front with a signed distance field, our method

same degree of detail as shown for real flames (c), or (d) Nielsen et al. [2022].
7 Discussion and Limitations
We present a physically grounded framework for combustion simu-
lation with support for chemical species, stoichiometric reactions,
and residual formation. Conceptually, our approach is related to
other species-transport fire models [Merci and Beji 2016; Nielsen
et al. 2022]. However, our method enables multi-phase interactions
between gas, liquid, and static solid materials, with droplet-based
evaporation and species-dependent rendering that reflect underly-
ing combustion chemistry. Compared to prior methods, our model
advances the state-of-the-art by unifying chemically driven combus-
tion with multi-phase simulation and species-aware visualization
in a single framework. Unlike artistic fire models, our approach
explicitly tracks species mass fractions and supports stoichiometric
control over reaction products. This enables simulations that dif-
ferentiate between complete and incomplete combustion based on
molecular composition. The inclusion of droplet-based evaporation
within a species-coupled solver allows realistic interactions between
flames and water – capturing both energy exchange and visible ef-
fects such as vaporization and suppression. This allows to test fire
suppression strategies in the safe confines of a computer simulation.
Furthermore, the physically motivated rendering pipeline ties tem-
perature and species content to appearance, providing interpretable
visual outputs rooted in combustion chemistry. While grounded in
existing fluid simulation techniques, the integration of these com-
ponents enables new types of fire–fluid interactions with a degree
of physical plausibility not previously demonstrated in real-time or
artist-controllable systems.
While effective for a range of scenarios, the framework has sev-
eral limitations. Solids are treated as static obstacles without thermal
deformation or melting. The flame front is not explicitly modeled,
leading to smoother transitions and limited accuracy in laminar or
small-scale flames. Furthermore, we do not not explicitly simulate
radiation in a detailed manner while heat transfer in liquids is sub-
ject to diffusion artifacts due to temperature sampling. Only one fuel
and liquid type is supported per simulation, with globally uniform
reaction parameters; localized variation in combustion complete-
ness is currently not modeled. Additionally, all species are advected
identically, ignoring differential effects such as CO2 stratification.
8 Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented a unified, hybrid framework for simulating multi-
phase combustion and fire suppression, with a combined Euler-
ian and Lagrangian representation to capture complex interactions
across solid, liquid, and gas phases. By explicitly modeling key
combustion species and phase transitions as well as by modeling
stoichiometry-aware heat release, our method supports simulating
diverse scenarios, including open flame propagation, water-based
flame extinction, and fire dynamics responsive to the environment.
Moreover, our framework bridges the gap between high-fidelity com-
bustion models and the efficiency required for interactive graphics.
With a novel hybrid multi-species thermodynamics model, we see
several avenues for future work. First, our current model simplifies
certain chemical formulations and assumes predefined reaction pa-
rameters; incorporating adaptive or learned chemical kinetics could
improve realism for a broader class of fuels. Second, we would like
to evaluate the different hydrocarbon fuels in more detail. A com-
parison with real shapes and combustion behaviors would enable
us to calibrate our approach even further. Third, enhanced mod-
eling of radiative heat transfer and soot formation would further
increase visual fidelity, especially in dense smoke scenarios. Another
interesting direction would be to couple our solver with methods
for describing geometric deformations of combustion. Finally, in-
tegrating this system into real-time engines or VR environments,
where user interaction and sensory feedback (e.g., heat, sound) play
a crucial role, remains an exciting frontier. We believe our work lays
a strong foundation for next-generation fire simulation tools that
are both physically grounded and artistically expressive, applicable
in visual media, safety training, and scientific visualization.

A.3 Parameter Tables
In Tab. 4 we provide values for parameters that depend on the physical and chemical
properties of materials, liquids and gases – these parameters are fixed. In Tab. 3 we
provide values for parameters that we used to generate the results in this paper. These
parameters can be configured to account for various different scenarios such as for
complete combustion, different liquid spray configurations, etc.
